# Raspberry Pi Trading Card Scanner Backend

A Raspberry Pi 4 backend that identifies a trading card from a JPEG posted by an
ESP32-CAM and returns its **recent-sales-derived price** (real completed TCGplayer
sale prices via [TCGAPIs](https://tcgapis.com)). It supports Pokémon and One Piece
through a provider abstraction, caches everything it can locally in SQLite +
on-disk tiers, and shows the latest scan on a Flask-rendered touchscreen page.

This is a modular, edge-CV rebuild. The pipeline is **OpenCV-first**: it leads with
cheap, discriminative signals (collector-number OCR + perceptual hashing) and only
falls back to heavier work (EasyOCR, remote lookups, ORB) when needed.

---

## What the pipeline does (in order)

1. **Upload** — ESP32-CAM sends a JPEG to `POST /scan`. Flask validates size + JPEG
   magic bytes and saves it (hash-deduplicated) under `data/scans/`.
2. **Detect & warp** (`card_detector`) — find the card's quadrilateral, perspective-
   correct it to a canonical upright image, and crop the **title** and **collector-
   number** regions. Everything downstream sees a clean, flat card.
3. **Local match first** (`image_matcher`) — perceptual hash (pHash) of the warped
   card is compared (Hamming distance) against an **in-memory index** of known cards.
   Close hit → done, no OCR or network. This is the OpenCV-first, O(N)-cheap path.
4. **OCR fallback** (`ocr_service`, EasyOCR) — only if the local match is weak. OCR
   runs on the small title/number crops, not the whole image, and the model is loaded
   **once** at startup.
5. **Normalize** (`normalizer`, RapidFuzz) — clean OCR text, extract/repair the
   collector number, fuzzy-match names, and de-duplicate candidates.
6. **Identity providers** (`providers/identity`) — query TCGAPIs (per game) for
   candidate cards.
7. **Rank** (`candidate_ranker`) — score each candidate:
   `0.5·number_exact + 0.3·name_fuzz + 0.2·image_score`. A misread number can't win
   alone — it must be corroborated by name/image.
8. **Price** (`pricing_service` → `providers/price`) — for the winning card, derive
   the price from **real recent sales** (`/api/v2/sales-history/:productId`).
9. **Persist & learn** — a confident remote match is written to SQLite with its pHash
   + ORB descriptors, so the **next** scan of that card resolves locally in step 3.
10. **History + display** — every attempt is written to `scan_history`; the touchscreen
    state file is updated and `/display` renders it.

## The matching cascade (and its guard rails)

Leads with the cheap signal, escalates only as needed, stops on confidence:

| Pass | Signal | Cost | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Collector-number OCR** (+ RapidFuzz) | ~free | Most discriminative; resolves most modern cards deterministically |
| 2 | **pHash** vs in-memory index | microseconds, O(N) | "Have I seen this exact card before?" — local, offline hits |
| 3 | **ORB** over the pHash top-K | seconds | **Tie-break only** on a small shortlist, never the whole DB |
| 4 | **Name OCR → provider search → rank** | network | Fallback when the number is unreadable |

Two failure modes are handled explicitly (the flaw check you asked about):

- **A misread collector number can confidently point at the wrong card.** So a number
  hit does **not** win on its own — `candidate_ranker` still folds in name-fuzz and
  image score before accepting (`REMOTE_MATCH_THRESHOLD`).
- **pHash of a lit/foil scan drifts from clean art.** So pHash uses a **Hamming-distance
  threshold** (`PHASH_MAX_DISTANCE`), not exact match, and ORB re-ranks the shortlist
  when pHash is ambiguous.

pHash is computed natively with OpenCV's DCT (no extra `imagehash` dependency).

## Price = recent sales, not "market price"

Your requirement was the *most recent sold price*. TCGAPIs exposes a real completed-
sales feed, so `providers/price/tcgapis_price.py` derives the value from actual sales:

- `GET /api/v2/sales-history/:productId` → recent completed sales.
- `PRICE_STRATEGY` chooses how to reduce them:
  - `last_sale` — the single most recent sale
  - `median_recent` — median of the last `PRICE_RECENT_SALES_WINDOW` sales (**default**, robust to outliers)
  - `mean_recent` — mean of the last N sales
- If sales history is empty and `PRICE_FALLBACK_TO_MARKET=true`, it falls back to the
  algorithmic market price (`/api/v2/prices/:productId`). The quote records its
  `basis` (e.g. `median_recent(10 sales)`) and `as_of` date so the UI never implies a
  live last-sale when it's really a fallback.

> **Plan note:** on TCGAPIs, `sales-history` and `prices` require the **Business** tier
> or higher; the catalog (identity) is available from **Hobby**. Set `TCGAPIS_API_KEY`
> in `.env`. With no key, the app runs entirely on the built-in **mock** provider so you
> can develop and test offline.

## Raspberry Pi 4 setup

Python 3.11+ recommended. Install system libs, then the Python deps:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip libgl1 libglib2.0-0

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt      # EasyOCR pulls in torch -- this is the slow one

cp .env.example .env                 # then edit: add TCGAPIS_API_KEY, adjust thresholds
python database/init_db.py
python database/seed_sample_cards.py # optional
python app.py                        # serves on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

`opencv-python-headless` is used deliberately (no GUI libs). EasyOCR is the heaviest
install; if you want it lighter later, `ocr_service.py` is the only file to change.

---

## Configuration (`.env`)

Key settings (full list in `.env.example`):

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOCAL_MATCH_THRESHOLD` | `0.72` | confidence to trust a local pHash/ORB match |
| `REMOTE_MATCH_THRESHOLD` | `0.60` | confidence to trust a remote candidate |
| `PHASH_MAX_DISTANCE` | `10` | max Hamming distance (of 64 bits) for a pHash hit |
| `ORB_SHORTLIST` | `5` | how many pHash candidates ORB re-ranks |
| `OCR_ENABLED` | `true` | set false to skip EasyOCR during quick dev |
| `TCGAPIS_API_KEY` | *(blank)* | your key; blank → mock provider |
| `PRICE_STRATEGY` | `median_recent` | `last_sale` \| `median_recent` \| `mean_recent` |
| `PRICE_RECENT_SALES_WINDOW` | `10` | sales considered for median/mean |
| `PRICE_REFRESH_MIN_HOURS` | `24` | don't re-fetch a card's price more often than this |
| `SCAN_WORKERS` | `1` | keep at 1 on a Pi 4 |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `12000000` | reject larger uploads (DoS guard) |

## API

- `GET /health` — status, card count, index size, DB size, whether a provider key is set.
- `POST /scan` — body is raw `image/jpeg` **or** multipart field `image`. Returns the
  final JSON result by default; add `?async=1` (or set `BLOCKING_SCAN_RESPONSE=false`)
  to get a `job_id` and poll `GET /jobs/<job_id>`.
- `GET /history?limit=25` — recent scan rows.
- `GET /display` — touchscreen UI (auto-refresh). `GET /` — status page.

`POST /scan` result:

```json
{
  "matched": true,
  "card_name": "Pikachu",
  "game": "pokemon",
  "set_name": "Base Set",
  "collector_number": "58/102",
  "price": 3.60,
  "currency": "USD",
  "price_basis": "median_recent(10 sales)",
  "price_as_of": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z",
  "confidence": 0.86,
  "source": "remote_api",
  "match_method": "ocr+provider",
  "ocr_text": "Pikachu\n58/102",
  "db_id": 123
}
```

### ESP32-CAM upload (raw JPEG)

```cpp
HTTPClient http;
http.begin("http://RASPBERRY_PI_IP:5000/scan");
http.addHeader("Content-Type", "image/jpeg");
int code = http.POST(jpegBuffer, jpegLength);
String response = http.getString();
http.end();
```

### Test with curl

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @sample-card.jpg \
  http://RASPBERRY_PI_IP:5000/scan
```

---

## Touchscreen (Freenove)

```bash
chromium-browser --kiosk http://localhost:5000/display
```

`/display` auto-refreshes and shows the card name, game, set, price (with its basis and
as-of date), confidence, and match source (`local_db` / `remote_api`).

---

## Database

SQLite file `carddata.db` (WAL mode). Full-size images live on disk; SQLite holds
compact metadata, the pHash index, prices, and history:

- `cards` — normalized card, `api_id`, `phash`, descriptor/image paths, latest price.
- `card_images`, `storage_files` — on-disk file index (tier, hash, size, LRU, expiry).
- `scan_history` — every attempt (matched or not) with confidence + source.
- `price_history` — appended only when a price changes.
- `api_cache` — provider query cache.

The **repository is the single SQL owner** (repo Issue #7), and the pipeline keeps an
**in-memory index** so a scan compares hashes in RAM and only writes to SQLite on a new
match — not a per-scan DB scan.

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

Tests run fully offline: a fake detector, a stub OCR, and the **mock** identity/price
providers. They need no network, no EasyOCR/torch, and no TCGAPIs key. The suite covers
the normalizer, the pHash matcher, the ranker, and an end-to-end pipeline run
(remote match → recent-sales price → subsequent local hit with no duplicate).

> Note: `normalizer.py` uses RapidFuzz when available and falls back to a stdlib
> `difflib` shim only if it isn't importable, so the app never hard-crashes on a minimal
> environment. On the Pi, `pip install -r requirements.txt` gives you the real RapidFuzz.

---

## Suggested build order

If you're bringing this up incrementally on the Pi:

1. `POST /scan` that just saves the JPEG + `/health` — prove the ESP32-CAM round-trip.
2. `card_detector` — eyeball warped crops saved to `data/cache/scan_debug/`.
3. `ocr_service` + `normalizer` on the number crop → resolve Pokémon by collector number.
4. `pricing_service` → attach the recent-sales price. **End-to-end value delivered.**
5. SQLite repository + in-memory index + pHash local matching + caching.
6. ORB tie-break, One Piece provider, confidence scoring, `/display`.
7. Maintenance, eviction, metrics, hardening.
